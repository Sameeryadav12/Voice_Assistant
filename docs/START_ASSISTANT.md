# How to Start Your Voice Assistant

## Fixed Issues ✓
1. Added missing sample_rate attribute to RecognitionConfig
2. Fixed speech recognition to use correct sample rates
3. Added comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the audio pipeline
4. Fixed audio input handler with automatic sample rate adjustment (44100Hz → 16000Hz)
5. Improved Voice Activity Detection (VAD) sensitivity
6. Added audio resampling for microphone compatibility

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run the Main Voice Assistant (with voice recognition)
```bash
cd D:\Projects\voice_assistant
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Run the Hybrid Mode (keyboard + voice)
```bash
cd D:\Projects\voice_assistant
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python main_hybrid.py
```

### Option 3: Test Audio Pipeline First
```bash
cd D:\Projects\voice_assistant
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python test_audio_pipeline.py
```

## Important Notes

### Microphone Setup
1. **Increase your microphone volume** in Windows Settings:
   - Go to Settings → System → Sound
   - Under Input, select your microphone
   - Increase the volume slider to 80-100%

2. **Reduce background noise**:
   - Speak clearly and close to the microphone
   - Minimize ambient noise

3. **Test your microphone**:
   - Run `test_audio_pipeline.py` first to verify audio capture
   - You should see audio levels > 100 when speaking

### Expected Behavior
- The assistant will now capture audio from your microphone
- Audio is automatically resampled from your device's native rate (e.g., 44100Hz) to 16000Hz for speech recognition
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is very sensitive now
- Both offline (Sphinx) and online (Google) speech recognition are attempted

### If Speech Recognition Still Fails
1. Make sure your microphone volume is HIGH (80-100%)
2. Speak loudly and clearly
3. Reduce background noise
4. Check internet connection (for Google speech recognition)
5. The system will show detailed logs to help diagnose issues

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Sample Rate Issues
- **Problem**: Microphone was 44100Hz but we were trying to record at 16000Hz
- **Fix**: Automatically detect and use native sample rate, then resample for recognition

### 2. Audio Pipeline
- **Problem**: Audio callbacks weren't triggering properly
- **Fix**: Improved callback chain with better error handling and logging

### 3. Voice Activity Detection
- **Problem**: VAD was too strict, missing speech
- **Fix**: Made VAD more sensitive (aggressiveness = 0, lower thresholds)

### 4. Error Handling
- **Problem**: Errors were silent, hard to debug
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive logging at every step with [COMPONENT] tags

## Troubleshooting

### Still no audio capture?
Check the logs for:
```
[START RECORDING] Using default input device: [Your Mic Name]
[AUDIO CALLBACK] Received audio: X bytes, max level: Y
```
- If max level is < 100, increase microphone volume
- If no callbacks appear, check microphone permissions

### Speech recognition fails?
The system tries Sphinx (offline) first, then Google (online):
- Sphinx works offline but less accurate
- Google needs internet but more accurate
- Both need clear audio with minimal noise

## Next Steps
1. Run `python test_audio_pipeline.py` to verify audio capture
2. If test passes, run `python main.py` for the full assistant
3. Say "Hey Sigma" followed by your command
4. Enjoy your working voice assistant!
