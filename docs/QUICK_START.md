## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If audio doesn't work:
1. Check microphone permissions
2. Verify audio device in system settings
3. Try running as administrator

### If imports fail:
1. Make sure virtual environment is activated
2. Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download NLTK data if prompted

### If UI doesn't show:
1. Check if CustomTkinter installed
2. Verify Python version (3.8+)
3. Try running from terminal
