TEST THESE IN ORDER
================================================================================

1. Hey Sigma, what time is it?
   Expected: "The current time is [time]"

2. Hey Sigma, what's the date?
   Expected: "Today is [date]"

3. Hey Sigma, open calculator
   Expected: "Opened calculator"
   

4. Hey Sigma, search for test
   Expected: Files found or "I couldn't find any files"

5. Hey Sigma, set a reminder for 2 minutes
   Expected: "Reminder set for [time]" or error message with details

6. Hey Sigma, what can you do?
   Expected: List of all capabilities

================================================================================
IF SOMETHING STILL DOESN'T WORK
================================================================================

Look at the PowerShell terminal window for error messages.
It will show detailed logs like:

[RECORDING LOOP] - Audio capture logs
[SPEECH RECOG] - Speech recognition logs
[AUDIO CALLBACK] - Callback logs

Any errors will show the exact problem!

================================================================================
REMINDER ABOUT VOICE MODE
================================================================================

To use VOICE instead of keyboard:
1. Fix your microphone volume first (see FINAL_STEPS.txt)
2. Run: python test_microphone_volume.py
3. Get levels above 10,000
4. Then run: python main.py
5. Click "Start Listening"
6. Speak the commands!

For now, keyboard mode (hybrid) is perfect for testing!
